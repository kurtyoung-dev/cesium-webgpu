This is the canonical list of named C-R follow-ups deferred during the principal-engineer review remediation (Batches 1-64). Each entry has a stable identifier (`C-R<n>-<NAME>`) that survives renumbering when slots are filled. Grouped by parent C-R finding from `PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md`.

Each entry: **What** / **Why deferred** / **Prerequisites** / **Estimated effort** (1 session ~ 1-3 hours) / **Impact** / **Trace**.

This inventory is add-only; ship items mark `(SHIPPED in Batch N)` next to the heading rather than removing the row.

## ADR-2026-04-28: Classification architecture — depth-sampling over stencil

**Decision:** Migrate `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer` from its current 2-pass stencil approach to WebGL's depth-texture sampling architecture. Pause the original C-R8 multi-frustum sweep (Sessions 2–4 of the stencil plan) until the depth-sampling architecture lands. After the migration, the multi-frustum work folds in for free as "swap the depth-source view per frustum" rather than "redirect a render pass into a scratch FBO and accumulate stencil bits."

**Why:**

- **Feature coverage.** Stencil approach can only classify against opaque surfaces that wrote depth. The depth-sampling approach can swap which depth source it reads from, unlocking translucent-on-translucent classification, PointCloud translucent classification (Batch 79 only fixed Models via selective depth-write), and `GroundPolylinePrimitive` (currently absent on WebGPU) on the same plumbing.
- **Architectural coherence with WebGL.** WebGL's classifier (`ShadowVolumeAppearanceFS.glsl`, `PolylineShadowVolumeFS.glsl`) samples `czm_globeDepthTexture`. Maintaining two architectures in parallel (stencil for WebGPU, depth-sample for WebGL) costs more long-term than one unified architecture.
- **Calendar.** Either path is ~5–6 sessions: finish stencil-based multi-frustum (Sessions 2–4) + later migrate, vs. migrate first + multi-frustum falls out for free. Same calendar, different end state.

**Trade-offs accepted:**

- Per-fragment cost goes up modestly (one depth-texture sample + reconstruction multiply) versus stencil's fixed-function early rejection. On desktop GPUs the delta benchmarks within ~2-3%; on mobile/integrated GPUs it can reach 5-15% in classification-heavy scenes. Acceptable for Cesium's typical workloads (terrain visualization, not mobile games).
- LOC churn: ~+800 LOC of WGSL classification shaders, ~-200 LOC of stencil pipeline plumbing. Net code growth, but a single conceptual surface.
- Sandcastle baseline regenerates after the cutover (visual regression suite is the safety net).

**Stays unchanged:**

- `depth24plus-stencil8` attachment format. The format's stencil bits are still used by `WebGPUInvertClassification` (separate concern, no migration plan today). Switching to `depth24plus` saves zero bytes per pixel on most drivers.
- Edge / shadow / OIT / picking pipelines — none of these use stencil today.
- The Batch 47 `WebGPUTranslucentTileClassification` scaffolding is the canonical example of the depth-pack approach in this codebase. The migration finally turns that scaffolding into the production classifier.

**Re-sequenced plan (replaces the earlier 6-session C-R8 sweep):**

1. **Migration Session 1** — WGSL port of `ShadowVolumeAppearanceVS/FS` + companion uniforms + first-cut single-pipeline `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer` swap that samples `globeDepthTexture` instead of doing the stencil 2-pass. Keep stencil pipelines compiled but unused as a one-batch fallback.
2. **Migration Session 2** — Runtime depth-source swap (globe-depth ↔ packed-translucent-depth). Wire the Batch 47 `_packedTranslucentDepthView` as the secondary source. Closes C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING and absorbs C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-CLASSIFICATION-DISPATCH.
3. **Migration Session 3** — Per-frustum FBO redirect now becomes "per-frustum depth-source bind group." Closes C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-MULTI-FRUSTUM. Composite + accumulation are no-ops (the depth-sample approach doesn't need them).
4. **Migration Session 4** — `WebGPUGroundPolylineRenderer` (port `PolylineShadowVolumeVS/FS` to WGSL). Reuses the Session 2 depth-source plumbing. Closes C-R8-GROUND-POLYLINE-NATIVE.
5. **Migration Session 5** — Delete unused stencil pipelines from `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer`. Drop the Batch 47 composite scaffolding (`composite()`, `_compositePipeline`, `COMPOSITE_WGSL`, `_runTranslucentTileClassificationComposite`) — the depth-sample architecture doesn't need it.

**Origin:** Audit + senior-dev review on 2026-04-28 after Batch 79 fixed the user-visible Model translucent-tile classification bug via selective depth-write. The audit revealed the stencil approach was a local minimum and the multi-frustum sweep would re-architect the wrong surface. See conversation transcript at `eb6dfaec-c294-4f46-966a-d8d9138c8bf0` for the full reasoning.

## C-R1 - command.renderState adoption tail

**Parent finding (PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:30):** `RenderStateToPipelineVariant.ts` foundation + 7 consumer renderers landed in Batches 30/35-37/39. Four named gaps remain.

### C-R1-CLASSIFICATION

**What:** Classification primitives (ClassificationPrimitive, GroundPolylinePrimitive) need their multi-pass renderState (stencil-depth pass, color pass, pick pass) routed through pipeline variants. Each pass uses distinct stencil/colorMask/depthFunc so WebGPU has to materialize three pipelines and dispatch in order.

**Why deferred:** WebGPU classification dispatch is a single-pipeline path; splitting into the WebGL-style 3-pass walk requires per-pass pipeline variant work plus renderer-level ordering change. Touches `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer.js` plus a new `WebGPUClassificationPrimitiveRenderer` that doesn't exist yet.

**Prerequisites:** None - foundation in place since Batch 30. `selectCommandVariant` (Batch 29) is the dispatch hook.

**Estimated effort:** 1 dedicated session.

**Impact:** 3D Tiles classification on WebGPU may bleed through tile boundaries when the stencil-depth pass doesn't run. Single-pass mode currently approximates the visible surface only.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:30.

### C-R1-COLLECTIONS-PER-ENCODER

**What:** Five collection renderers (Billboard, Cloud, PointPrimitive, Polyline, Label) don't call `applyPerEncoderState(passEncoder, renderState)` before draw - they rely on default-baked state. Adding the per-encoder call enables custom `setStencilReference` / `setBlendConstant` / `setScissorRect` overrides without rebuilding the pipeline.

**Why deferred:** Collection draws are batched per-collection rather than per-command, so renderState has to be hoisted from a representative member or the collection's owner.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session.

**Impact:** Custom blend constants / stencil refs set on individual entities in a collection are silently ignored. Default-baked state is correct for ~99% of uses.

**Trace:** Batch 39 scope cut in REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md; no explicit marker yet, adding via this entry.

### C-R1-GLOBE-RENDERSTATE

**What:** `WebGPUGlobeSurfaceRenderer.ts` builds pipeline variants from local hard-coded state instead of consuming upstream `command.renderState`. The provider sets per-tile depthMask / cullFace based on tile elevation/back-facing geometry; the WebGPU path overrides with a fixed front-face cull.

**Why deferred:** Globe surface renderer has its own custom pipeline-variant builder predating `RenderStateToPipelineVariant.ts`; routing the upstream renderState through requires reconciling two distinct variant key shapes.

**Prerequisites:** Bundles naturally with C-R7-RENDERER-MIGRATION (route GlobeSurface through central pipeline cache).

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 sessions.

**Impact:** Underground / inverted tiles may render with wrong cull mode at the rim of the globe (e.g., transitioning across a steep cliff). Minor artifacting.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:30.

### C-R1-PRIMITIVE-DERIVED

**What:** `WebGPUPrimitiveCommands.js` doesn't yet build pipeline variants for the derived `colorCommand` / `depthOnlyCommand` / `pickCommand` / `pickDepthCommand` paths - only the primary color command's renderState propagates.

**Why deferred:** Each derived command needs its own variant-key contribution. The dispatcher already routes; the variant-build path needs per-derived-command branches.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session.

**Impact:** Pick passes and depth-only passes for primitives may not honor custom blend / stencil settings. Color pass works correctly.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:30.

### C-R1-TILE-BATCH

**What:** `Cesium3DTileBatchTable.js` per-feature renderState (depthMask flip for `_depthOnlyCommand` derivation, custom color blend for translucent tiles) is not consumed by the WebGPU model command emission path.

**Why deferred:** Routing through the renderState pipe requires teaching `WebGPUModelRenderer.js` to inspect batch-table per-feature state, which has its own representation that's not yet typed.

**Prerequisites:** Pairs with C-R9-MODEL-FEATURE-PICK - both touch batch-table integration.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 sessions.

**Impact:** Per-feature transparency in 3D Tiles renders without the alpha-driven depthMask flip on WebGPU; visible as z-fighting on overlapping translucent features.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:30.

## C-R4 - glTF KHR extensions

### C-R4-GLTF-KHR

**What:** Six glTF KHR extensions silently dropped on the WebGPU model path:

- **KHR_texture_transform** - affine UV transform per texture. ~10 sampling sites in `ModelPBRComplete.wgsl`.
- **KHR_materials_clearcoat** - second specular lobe. Clearcoat normal map + roughness uniform + BRDF branch.
- **KHR_materials_anisotropy** - anisotropic GGX roughness. Direction texture + tangent-space derivation.
- **KHR_materials_specular** - specular factor + color tint. 2 textures + 2 uniforms.
- **KHR_materials_iridescence** - thin-film iridescence. Thickness/IOR uniforms + texture + Fresnel modulation.
- **KHR_materials_sheen** - fabric/cloth velvet term. Sheen color/roughness + Charlie distribution lobe.
- **KHR_materials_volume** - transmission/volumetric attenuation. Thickness texture + IOR + attenuation distance + transmission lobe.

**Why deferred:** Major shader-family work. Each extension is a distinct BRDF branch with its own texture binding + uniform plumbing. Six sibling `Model*Stage.wgsl` files sit on disk imported by nothing.

**Prerequisites:** WGSL include strategy decision - either wire `//>>ifdef` preprocessor multi-file include (WebGL `*Stage.glsl` pattern), or fold all extensions inline behind define gates. Inline balloons file past the 1000-line CLAUDE.md threshold.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session per extension = 6, plus 1 for include-pipeline decision and 1 for orchestration. ~8 sessions / multi-week workstream.

**Impact:** Production glTF models lose visual fidelity proportional to KHR extensions shipped. KHR_texture_transform is in nearly every modern glTF asset (atlased tilesets) - highest-impact single gap.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:101-102; OVERSIGHT_AUDIT_2026_04_25.md s2.

## C-R7 - Central pipeline cache adoption tail

**Parent finding:** Pipeline cache (`WebGPURenderPipelineCache`) instantiated + key-correct + device-loss-invalidated in Batches 33-34, audited Batch 52. First-cut consumer migration Batch 56, second cut Batch 62.

### ~~C-R7-RENDERER-MIGRATION-REMAINING~~ DONE 2026-04-29 (audit)

**Resolution:** Audit (2026-04-29, this session) found `WebGPUGlobeSurfaceRenderer` has been routing through the central `webgpuPipelineCache` since **Batch 75** (`_resolveGlobePipelineEntry` calls `pipelineCache.getPipelineSync` / `getPipeline`; the local `_pipelineCache: Map<string, GlobePipelineEntry>` now holds DESCRIPTORS, not pipelines, with the actual `GPURenderPipeline` resolved through the central cache and a sync-fallback `device.createRenderPipeline()` only when no central cache is wired). The `WebGPUShaderModuleCache` is also already adopted (Batch 20).

That leaves only:

- **`WebGPUModelRenderer`** — special-case, blocked on the KHR-extension shader-family work (C-R4-GLTF-KHR). Its pipeline cache adoption pairs with the shader-module dedup work because two models with identical material settings need to share modules to share pipelines.
- **`WebGPUAutoExposure`** — compute pipeline, out of scope until a `WebGPUComputePipelineCache` exists.

Both are tracked under their own work items below; this entry is closed.

**Adopter count:** 15 renderers route through `webgpuPipelineCache` (Polyline, PointPrimitive, GroundPrimitive, GaussianSplat, EllipsoidPrimitive, BufferPrimitive, DepthPlane, Cloud, Voxel, Label, Billboard, Environment Sun, Environment Moon, PointCloud, **GlobeSurface**) + Weather render + VolumetricFog composite.

**Closing batch:** Audit reframe (2026-04-29) confirmed Batch 75 already shipped this for GlobeSurface; the prior wording of this entry was stale.

**Trace:** Verified by grep of `WebGPUGlobeSurfaceRenderer.ts` for `device.createRenderPipeline` (one match — the synchronous-fallback path inside `_resolveGlobePipelineEntry`, used only when the central cache isn't available).

### C-R7-SHADER-MODULE-DEDUP

**What:** Cross-renderer `GPUShaderModule` sharing. Wiring `WebGPUShaderModuleCache` into all renderers (12 of ~17 use it today) lets identical sources actually dedupe.

**Progress:**

- Batch 72 (2026-04-27) added Cloud + Voxel + Weather (render + compute shaders).
- Batch 74 (2026-04-27) added Environment (Sun + Moon), VolumetricFog (compute + composite), PointCloud (default + LOD).

Existing adopters from earlier batches: Polyline, PointPrimitive, Billboard, Label, GlobeSurface.

**Why deferred:** Without dedup, routing `WebGPUModelRenderer` through `webgpuPipelineCache` (Batch 56's deferred case) wouldn't actually share - two models with identical material settings still produce distinct shader modules, distinct pipeline cache keys.

**Prerequisites:** None - `WebGPUShaderModuleCache.ts` exists since Batch 22.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session for ModelRenderer adoption pass.

**Impact:** Memory pressure on shader-heavy scenes (3D Tilesets with many distinct glTF assets sharing material settings).

**Trace:** REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md:2399 (Batch 52 audit), Batches 72/74 lists; OVERSIGHT_AUDIT_2026_04_25.md s3.

## C-R8 - Translucent classification follow-ups

**Parent finding:** Six C-R8 sub-items shipped Batches 35-51 (globeDepth, VOXELS-before-OPAQUE, 2D frustum jitter, InvertClassification, Edge FBO+inline, Translucent tile classification first-cut). Three named follow-ups remain on translucent classification leg; MSAA gate closed Batch 61.

### C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-DEPTH-ONLY

**Status: Resolved (different mechanism) — Batches 78–79.**

**What (original framing):** Translucent depth capture was over-broad — `executePackDepth` copies ALL translucent geometry's depth, not just `depthForTranslucentClassification`-flagged 3D-tile content. WebGL's selective behaviour derives a `_depthOnlyCommand` per flagged command per `Cesium3DTile.js:1084`.

**Architectural reframe (audit, 2026-04-28):** WebGPU does NOT consume the packed-depth texture the way the original framing assumed. The active classification renderer (`WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer`) is a stencil-based two-pass approach with no depth-texture sampling — neither `_packedDepthTexture` nor `_globeDepthTexture` is bound to any classification pipeline. Filtering the pack-depth contributors only matters once a depth-sampling classifier exists (tracked separately as **C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING** below).

What the user-visible bug actually is: when a translucent 3D tile overlaps a classification volume, the scene-FB depth at translucent pixels is whatever's behind the tile (globe), so the volume draws on the globe under the tile rather than on the tile surface.

**Batch 78 (gating):**

- `WebGPUDrawCommand` now carries the `depthForTranslucentClassification` flag (Cesium3DTile.js:1084 lands on the WebGPU command instance; previously the assignment hit the field as `undefined` since it didn't exist on the class).
- `WebGPUTranslucentTileClassification.executeTranslucentDepthPass` accepts a `flaggedCommandsPresent` argument and short-circuits the entire pack-depth pipeline (no copy, no MSAA source recording, no pack pass) when no commands in the frustum need translucent classification depth.
- `WebGPUSceneRenderer` scans the frustum's TRANSLUCENT command list before invoking the translucent-depth path.

**Batch 79 (the actual fix — selective depth-write):**

- `WebGPUModelPipelineCache.getDepthWritePipeline(alphaMode, doubleSided)` builds a sibling pipeline of `getPipeline` with `depthWriteEnabled = true` forced on for ALPHA_BLEND. Layout, vertex, fragment, and blend state are identical to the standard variant; only the depth-write bit differs. Cached separately so the standard translucent path (no depth write, alpha-correct compositing) is unchanged for non-tile content.
- `WebGPUModelRenderer` eagerly builds the depth-write variant for every BLEND primitive and stashes it on the `WebGPUDrawCommand` as `classificationDepthPipeline`.
- `WebGPUDrawCommand.execute()` swaps to that variant when `depthForTranslucentClassification === true`. The bind groups, vertex buffers, and draw call are unchanged.

Net effect: translucent 3D tile surfaces populate the scene-FB depth attachment, so the existing stencil-based GroundPrimitive classifier clips its volumes against the tile surface instead of the globe behind it — matching WebGL's user-visible behaviour without porting WebGL's depth-texture sampling architecture.

**Side effect (intended):** translucent labels behind translucent 3D tiles will now be occluded (more physically correct than WebGL's "label sees through everything"). Acceptable.

**Coverage gaps (intentional, deferred to Path A continuation):**

- PointCloud / batched primitive content does not yet have a depth-write variant — only Model (b3dm/i3dm/glb) primitives do. PointCloud translucent tiles will still mis-classify until C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING lands the cleaner architecture.
- Multi-frustum accumulation is still single-frustum (see C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-MULTI-FRUSTUM).
- Depth-only WGSL variants per command (mirroring WebGL's `_depthOnlyCommand`) are still not built — but their value disappears with the new architecture.

**Trace:** REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md:2130; Batch 78 + Batch 79 shipped 2026-04-28.

### C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-MULTI-FRUSTUM

**Status: Paused — folded into Migration Session 3 of the depth-sampling architecture pivot (see ADR-2026-04-28 above).**

**What (original):** Multi-frustum accumulation not wired. `executePackDepth` runs once per frame, capturing only last-rendered frustum's depth.

**Why paused:** the architectural pivot replaces the stencil-based classifier with depth-texture sampling. In the new architecture, "multi-frustum" reduces to "swap the bound depth-source view per frustum draw" rather than "redirect a render pass into a scratch FBO and accumulate stencil bits." Building the stencil-based accumulation now would land code that the architecture migration deletes a few sessions later.

The Batch 47 scaffolding (`_classificationColorTexture`, `composite()`, `_runTranslucentTileClassificationComposite`, `_ensureCompositePipeline`, `COMPOSITE_WGSL`) was designed for the stencil-accumulation path. Migration Session 5 is the point where it gets removed, NOT before — the depth-sampling consumer needs `_packedTranslucentDepthView` and `_packedDepthTexture` to remain wired for as long as the stencil classifier still ships in the same build.

**Re-scoped impact:** Multi-frustum correctness folds into Migration Session 3 (per-frustum depth-source bind groups). No standalone work item remains.

**Trace:** REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md:2132. Audit 2026-04-28.

### C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-CLASSIFICATION-DISPATCH

**What (original framing):** Classification primitive shaders sample `globeDepthTexture`; need option to sample `packedTranslucentDepthView` (Batch 47 pack pipeline) when translucent depth available — that's how WebGL gets translucent-on-translucent classification right.

**Audit reframe (2026-04-28):** WebGPU's only classification primitive renderer (`WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer`) is a stencil-based two-pass approach with NO depth-texture sampling. The original "swap depth source" framing assumed a port of WebGL's `ShadowVolumeAppearanceFS` / `PolylineShadowVolumeFS` depth-sampling architecture. We did not port that.

The framing splits into two distinct items:

1. **C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING** (architectural, future) — replaces the stencil approach with a depth-sampling approach so the renderer can read `_packedDepthTexture` for translucent-on-translucent. Tracked as a separate item below.
2. **DISPATCH proper** — the original WebGL framing isn't directly portable. Closing this item now in favour of the depth-sampling architecture follow-up.

**Why deferred / superseded:** Folded into C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING.

**Status: Superseded — closed by audit; replaced by C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING.**

**Trace:** REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md:2133. Audit 2026-04-28.

### C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-DEPTH-SAMPLING

**What:** WebGPU's `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer` uses a stencil-based two-pass classifier. WebGL's classifier (`ShadowVolumeAppearanceFS`, `PolylineShadowVolumeFS`) samples `czm_globeDepthTexture` instead. The depth-sampling approach is what enables:

- Translucent-on-translucent classification (sample `_packedTranslucentDepthView` per Batch 47 pack pipeline).
- Single-pass classification (no stencil clear / two-draw cost).
- Cleaner shader extension surface — derived data uniforms (e.g., `czm_globeDepthTexture`-based effects) drop in naturally.

**Why deferred:** Architectural rewrite of the classifier. The stencil approach is correct for opaque-tile classification (the common case) and Batch 79 patches the translucent-tile case via selective depth-write. Depth-sampling is the principled long-term architecture.

**Prerequisites:** Pairs with C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-MULTI-FRUSTUM (the per-frustum FBOs MULTI-FRUSTUM ships are the natural source of `_packedTranslucentDepthView`).

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 sessions. Port WGSL of `ShadowVolumeAppearanceFS` + `PolylineShadowVolumeFS`; rewire `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer` to bind depth source instead of stencil-clip; add the `(globe-depth, translucent-depth)` runtime swap MULTI-FRUSTUM enables.

**Impact:**

- **Without it:** PointCloud / batched-primitive translucent tiles still mis-classify (only Model path got Batch 79's selective depth-write). Translucent-on-translucent classification doesn't render.
- **With it:** Full WebGL parity for the classification system, single architecture covering all alpha modes and all content types.

**Trace:** Replaces C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-CLASSIFICATION-DISPATCH per audit 2026-04-28.

### ~~C-R8-CLASSIFICATION-PRIMITIVE-GEOM-PLUMBING~~ FIXED 2026-04-28 (Batch 81)

**Resolution:** Two distinct gaps that compounded into a single visible failure:

1. **Renderer was reading the wrong nesting level.** `_webgpuGeometryData` IS populated by `Scene/PrimitiveGeometryHelpers.js:788` on the innermost Cesium `Primitive`, but the wrapping chain for a `GroundPrimitive` is `_GroundPrimitive` → `._primitive` (`ClassificationPrimitive`) → `._primitive` (`Primitive`) → `._webgpuGeometryData`. The renderer was reading the slot off the `_GroundPrimitive` argument directly, where it never lives. **Fix:** walk-the-chain lookup at `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer.js` — try `primitive._webgpuGeometryData ?? primitive._primitive?._webgpuGeometryData ?? primitive._primitive?._primitive?._webgpuGeometryData`. Direct `Primitive` and `ClassificationPrimitive` callers work through the same lookup with shorter chains.

2. **`createVertexBuffer` was called with the wrong arguments.** The legacy renderer's call site was `WebGPUBuffer.createVertexBuffer(device, vbData.byteLength, false, label)` — but the API is `(device, data, label)`. Passing `byteLength` (a number) as `data` made the inner `data.byteLength` lookup return `undefined`, which the `createBuffer` validation rejected as "Value is not of type 'unsigned long long'". **Fix:** pass the typed array directly; drop the redundant `device.queue.writeBuffer` call (the helper writes data internally).

**Producer side was already correct.** `ClassificationPrimitive.js:417` constructs an internal `Primitive`, and that internal Primitive's `update` → `createVertexArray` flow runs the existing `PrimitiveGeometryHelpers.js:788` populator. No new populator was needed; the chain just needed to be walked on the renderer side.

**Validation:** A programmatically added `RectangleGeometry`-backed `GroundPrimitive` now reaches the renderer with `cache.vertexCount = 384, cache.indexCount = 1716, cache.indexFormat = "uint16"` populated, the depth-sample bind group constructed, and zero console errors during dispatch. Visual output verification is gated on a separate WebGPU canvas-rendering issue (the canvas appears black even on the default CesiumViewer page without any classification primitives — surfaced 2026-04-28, separate investigation).

**Files touched:** `packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer.js`. Minor: marked the legacy stencil pipelines now compile and dispatch correctly too — both classifier paths are runtime-functional after Batch 81 modulo the canvas-rendering investigation.

**Closing batch:** Batch 81.

### C-R8-GROUND-POLYLINE-NATIVE — PARTIAL (renderer scaffolded; vsMain off-screen bug)

**Status as of 2026-04-30 (Batch 111):** `WebGPUGroundPolylineRenderer` exists with full color + pick pipelines, depth-sample bind groups, batch-table snapshot, vertex/index buffer upload, and morph-mode pipeline pair. The renderer is registered with `FeatureRendererKey.GROUND_POLYLINE` and the WebGL-side `GroundPolylinePrimitive` skips `_createShaderProgramFunction` when the alternate renderer is active so the WebGL DrawCommands don't crash in pick-shader derivation. Shadow-volume geometry is dispatched and the depth-classifier fragment runs.

**Known bug:** vsMain produces vertices that fall outside NDC. Diagnostic confirmed (Batch 111 zoom test):

1. Override `colorFS` → solid magenta: NO magenta pixels visible (FS not running on visible fragments).
2. Override `vsMain` with a fullscreen-NDC-quad diagnostic: magenta APPEARED.
3. Conclusion: pipeline + bind groups + FS are correct; the vertex shader's transform produces off-screen geometry.

Likely root cause is one of: (a) RTE encoding mismatch between `positionHigh`/`positionLow` and the camera-relative transform, (b) wrong matrix selected for shadow-volume extrusion (the WebGL VS uses `czm_modelView` for prev/next neighbour expansion plus separate logic per scene mode), (c) batch instance buffer indexing off-by-one between vertex layout and the storage-buffer fetch.

**Why still deferred:** Multi-hour vsMain bisection — not blocking anything outside `GroundPolylinePrimitive`. Ground polylines are a niche visualization (route overlays, GPS tracks); apps that need them today still get blank output but no crash, and the rest of the classification fleet (`GroundPrimitive`, `ClassificationPrimitive`) renders correctly.

**Prerequisites:** None — bug fix is local to `WebGPUGroundPolylineRenderer.js` / `PolylineShadowVolumeVS.wgsl` (or the inlined VS in the renderer).

**Estimated effort:** 1 session, focused VS bisection. Capture vsMain output for a known-good WebGL frame (pull `gl_Position` from a debug RenderDoc capture or instrument the WebGL VS), diff against WGSL, find the encoding/matrix mismatch.

**Impact:** Polylines on terrain are not visible on WebGPU even though the renderer dispatches commands. No crash, no validation warnings — just invisible output.

**Trace:** Audit 2026-04-28; bug isolated 2026-04-30 in Batch 111 via `Tools/visual-regression/verify-ground-polyline-zoom.mjs`.

### C-R8-VECTOR-3DTILE-CLAMPED-POLYLINES — DEFERRED (Batch 113)

**Status:** `Vector3DTileClampedPolylines` (terrain-clamped polyline volumes for 3D Tiles vector content) does NOT have a WebGPU FR yet. The BUILD-VAR-HAZARD guard at the top of `createShaders` prevents the WebGL `ShaderProgram.fromCache` call from running on WebGPU contexts; the result is silent no-render rather than a crash, but clamped vector-tile polylines (road overlays, GPS tracks coming from vector tile sources) are invisible on WebGPU.

**What's shipped in Batch 113 (companions):**

- `Vector3DTilePrimitive` (extruded polygon classifier) — full FR in `WebGPUVector3DTilePrimitiveRenderer.js`. Uses the depth-sample classifier architecture from `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer` (ADR-2026-04-28).
- `Vector3DTilePolylines` (NON-clamped 3D polylines) — full FR in `WebGPUVector3DTilePolylinesRenderer.js`. Ports the screen-space miter expansion from `PolylineCommon.glsl::getPolylineWindowCoordinatesEC`. Near-plane clipping is the only deferred piece (~40 LOC).

**What ClampedPolylines needs that the other two don't:**

- 7-attribute vertex layout (`startEllipsoidNormal`, `endEllipsoidNormal`, `startPositionAndHeight`, `endPositionAndHeight`, `startFaceNormalAndVertexCornerIds`, `endFaceNormalAndHalfWidths`, `batchId`). The CPU side is already produced by `createVectorTileClampedPolylines` in the worker.
- Per-vertex shadow-volume extrusion: each input segment becomes a 6-vertex prism along the ellipsoid normal. The VS reconstructs the prism corner from the `vertexCornerId` in the start-face-normal attribute and extrudes by `halfWidth` along the perpendicular face normal.
- 5-plane fragment-side clipping (start cap, end cap, right miter, plus aligned-plane checks for tex coord). Same architecture as `WebGPUGroundPolylineRenderer` but with a different vertex-side layout.
- Depth-sample classifier in the FS: read `czm_globeDepthTexture`, reconstruct EC position, apply the 5 plane tests, discard if outside.

**Why deferred:** ~600-800 LOC port (full WGSL VS + FS + 7-attribute interleave + ensure-buffer plumbing + plane-distance tests). Realistically a 2-session effort. The polygon and non-clamped-polyline FRs cover the most common Vector3DTile scenarios already.

**Prerequisites:** None — none of the other deferred items block this. Reuses the same depth-sample plumbing as `WebGPUGroundPrimitiveRenderer` (`_globeDepthView`, `_packedTranslucentDepthView`).

**Estimated effort:** 2 sessions.

**Impact:** Apps using `Vector3DTileClampedPolylines` (vector tile road / boundary / GPS-track overlays clamped to terrain) get blank output on WebGPU. Other vector-tile content (polygons, non-clamped polylines) renders correctly. No crash.

**Trace:** Batch 113 (Polygon + Polyline FRs landed; Clamped follow-up deferred).

## C-R9 - Pick command tail

**Parent finding:** Five WebGPU renderers were missing pick paths. All five shipped at primitive granularity through Batches 30/31/53/54. Three named follow-ups remain.

### C-R9-MODEL-FEATURE-PICK

**What:** Per-feature pick on glTF Models. `scene.pick()` over a Model returns the Model object; per-feature pick (one target per `EXT_mesh_features` / `EXT_structural_metadata` feature) needs the pick FBO to read per-fragment featureId.

**Why deferred:** Requires KHR feature-ID integration on pick FBO side. Color path reads featureId (Batch 48 edge-feature-id work); pick path doesn't emit it yet.

**Prerequisites:** Pairs with C-R1-TILE-BATCH (both touch batch-table integration).

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 sessions.

**Impact:** 3D Tiles per-feature interactivity (clicking single building in city tileset) doesn't work on WebGPU. Workaround: client decode pick result against feature table manually.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:220 (Batch 54 "Still open").

### C-R9-MODEL-PICK-TRANSLUCENT

**What:** Translucent-with-OIT pick - depth-correct alpha-blended picking through OIT framebuffer. Currently pick forces depth-write ON for ALL alpha modes (front-most fragment wins).

**Why deferred:** OIT writes accum + revealage textures, not pickable color. Routing pick through OIT requires parallel pick-OIT pipeline accumulating pickIds with same weights, resolving at composite.

**Prerequisites:** None - OIT path itself is stable.

**Estimated effort:** 2 sessions.

**Impact:** Picking through stacked translucent surfaces (glass building facades) returns whichever closest, not what user visually identifies. Acceptable first-cut.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:220 (Batch 54 "Translucent-with-OIT pick").

### C-R9-VOXEL-CELL-PICK

**What:** Per-cell granularity for voxel pick. `scene.pick()` returns the primitive; per-cell pick needs cell coords (3 x u32) packed into pickColor or out-of-band.

**Why deferred:** Voxel cell coords don't fit in 4-byte pickColor - needs separate buffer/texture + different resolve path.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 sessions.

**Impact:** Voxel hover/click selection of individual cells doesn't work. Coarse primitive-level pick works.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:222 (Batch 53 "Per-cell / per-tile pick is out of scope").

## C-R10 - Point-light shadow tail

**Parent finding:** Cube-shadow cast (Batch 34) + Model FS receive (Batch 57) + soft-shadow PCF (Batch 63). Two named follow-ups remain.

### C-R10-GLOBE-POINT-LIGHT

**What:** Globe terrain receive shader extension for cube depth. `GlobeTerrain.wgsl` keeps using 2D shadow path; point-light shadows on terrain are uncommon.

**Why deferred:** Adding point-light receive to terrain requires copying `samplePointShadow` helper + new BGL binding into `GlobeTerrain.wgsl` AND updating effects bind-group consumer (currently same UBO layout as Model FS, so cube binding is a BGL grow that globe also has to consume). Architectural cost, low payoff.

**Prerequisites:** None - Batch 57's BGL is already set up to grow.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session if requested.

**Impact:** Point lights don't cast shadows on terrain on WebGPU. Models, primitives stay shadowed correctly.

**Trace:** REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md (Batch 57 "Scope cuts"); PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:247.

### C-R10-CAST-LINEAR-DEPTH

**What:** Alternative cast pipeline writing linear depth (`distance / lightRadius`) via `@builtin(frag_depth)` instead of perspective-Z attachment. Would let receive use simpler `axisDist / farPlane` reference.

**Why deferred:** Perspective-Z path correctly round-trips against existing cast output. Switching to linear depth requires receive AND cast changing in lockstep - coordinated swap, not strict improvement. Tracking only because future profiling could shift the calculus.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session.

**Impact:** None today - current perspective-Z math is correct and cheap (two divides + one cube sample per fragment). Pure micro-optimization.

**Trace:** REVIEW_FIX_PROGRESS.md (Batch 57 "Scope cuts").

---

## C-R12 - Per-object cache walk

### C-R12-PER-OBJECT-CACHES

**What:** Extend `onDeviceInvalidated` event subscriber walk to per-Model / per-Collection / per-Renderer object caches. Subsystem-level caches (Bloom/AO/DoF/GodRays/AutoExposure/scene FB) are wired; per-object caches (`model._webgpuCache`, `clippingPlanes._webgpuCache`) are not.

**Why deferred:** Most per-object caches DO get rebuilt next frame because owning feature renderer's destroy + recreate runs anyway. Belt-and-suspenders correctness.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Estimated effort:** 1 session.

**Impact:** None observed - device-loss recovery currently works for the test scenes that have hit it. Risk: a future cache that doesn't get reaped on next-frame churn would silently use stale GPU handles.

**Trace:** PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md:283 ("tracked as **FOLLOW-UP C-R12-PER-OBJECT-CACHES** if it becomes necessary").

## NEW-4 — Genuine WebGPU bugs surfaced by TRULY FINAL Sandcastle pass (Batch 66)

The first end-to-end Sandcastle WebGPU verification (`SANDCASTLE_BATCH_66_TRULY_FINAL_REPORT.md`) flushed multiple second-layer bugs that only appeared once `Viewer.createAsync` actually initialized the WebGPU backend on the demos. NEW-3-A/B/C closed inline; NEW-4-B/C/F closed inline; NEW-4-A/D/E genuinely multi-session and tracked here.

### ~~NEW-4-A — EdgeVisibilityPipelineStage uses WebGL-only `Buffer.getBufferData`~~ FIXED 2026-04-25 (Batch 67)
**Resolution:** Took architecture option (b) — eager retention at upload — over (a) async pipeline-stage refactor. (a) was multi-session architectural work touching every pipeline stage's contract; (b) is two narrow edits and reuses the existing `loadTypedArray` plumbing. `GltfLoader.loadVertexAttribute` now sets `outputTypedArray = true` on every vertex attribute when `frameState.context.isWebGPU` AND the primitive carries `EXT_mesh_primitive_edge_visibility`, so `EdgeVisibilityPipelineStage`'s existing `defined(attribute.typedArray) ? attribute.typedArray : ModelReader.readAttributeAsTypedArray(...)` branch always takes the fast path on WebGPU and never invokes the WebGL-only sync readback. `EdgeVisibilityPipelineStage.process` also gained a defensive guard that bails cleanly with a `console.error` if the typed array is missing on WebGPU (safety net for any future loader path that skips retention). WebGL keeps prior behaviour — typed arrays still freed after upload, falling back through `Buffer.getBufferData` as before. Mirrors the pre-existing `loadIndices` retention pattern that already special-cased `hasEdgeVisibility` for the index typed array.
**Files touched:** [packages/engine/Source/Scene/GltfLoader.js](../packages/engine/Source/Scene/GltfLoader.js) (loadVertexAttribute retention), [packages/engine/Source/Scene/Model/EdgeVisibilityPipelineStage.js](../packages/engine/Source/Scene/Model/EdgeVisibilityPipelineStage.js) (defensive WebGPU guard).
**Sandcastle verification:** `WebGPU Edge Visibility.html` and `WebGPU Edge Feature ID.html` both PASS in `node Tools/visual-regression/sandcastle-batch-66-final-runner.mjs` (previously hard-FAIL with `DeveloperError: A WebGL 2 context is required.` from `Buffer.getBufferData` thrown in `buildTriangleAdjacency`).
**Closing batch:** Batch 67.

### ~~NEW-4-D — Texture3D constructor has WebGL-only guard~~ FIXED 2026-04-25 (Batch 67)
**Resolution:** `Texture3D` constructor now short-circuits to `new WebGPUTexture3D(options)` when `context.isWebGPU` is true, BEFORE the WebGL2 `webgl2` guard runs. JS constructor return-value semantics replace `this` with the returned WebGPU instance, so every caller (`Megatexture.js`, future volumetric features) gets the right backend with zero call-site changes. The webgl-only build variant remains correct because the `WebGPUTexture3D` import is redirected to `emptyModule.js` (Proxy that throws on instantiation) and the dispatch is gated on `isWebGPU`, which is false in those builds. NEW-4-E is now reachable — Voxel demos reach `WebGPUVoxelRenderer.update()` and the WGSL pipeline-build step.
**Files touched:** [packages/engine/Source/Renderer/Texture3D.js](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/Texture3D.js) (added import + 12-line WebGPU dispatch in constructor + factory comment).
**Closing batch:** Batch 67. See [WEBGPU_DEBUGGING_LOG.md § Session 39](WEBGPU_DEBUGGING_LOG.md) for full root-cause + fix narrative.

### ~~NEW-4-E — Voxel color pipeline WGSL parse error at line 113~~ FIXED 2026-04-25 (Batch 68)

**Captured live error (verbatim, port 8090 dev server, ctx UUID redacted):**

```text
[CesiumJS:webgpu:<ctx-uuid>] Shader "unlabeled" compilation ERROR at line 113:1: missing return at end of function
```

This matched the Batch-67 prediction exactly — naga couldn't prove that `fragmentMain` returns on every control-flow path because the `if (tr.x > tr.y) { discard; }` and `if (accumA < 0.01) { discard; }` early-outs in WGSL do NOT count as function terminators. `discard` is a fragment-state mutation, not a control-flow return.
**Resolution:** Took candidate (a) — paired each `discard;` with an explicit `return vec4<f32>(0.0);` in both `fragmentMain` and `fragmentPickMain`. The returned value is dropped by the discard so the colour is irrelevant; the explicit `return` gives naga the terminator it requires. Also added a trailing `return vec4<f32>(0.0);` after the terminal `discard;` at the end of `fragmentPickMain` (the no-hit fallthrough). Verified by re-running `node Tools/visual-regression/sandcastle-batch-66-final-runner.mjs` against a worktree-private dev server on port 8090 — the `missing return at end of function` error is gone from the Voxel Pick demo's console.
**Files touched:** [packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUVoxelRenderer.ts](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUVoxelRenderer.ts) (3 paired `discard; return` edits + 1 trailing fallthrough return + JSDoc-style WGSL comments explaining the naga requirement).
**Closing batch:** Batch 68.

### ~~NEW-4-G — Voxel WGSL `textureSample` not in uniform control flow~~ FIXED 2026-04-26 (Batch 69)

**Resolution:** Took candidate (a) — replaced `textureSample(voxelTex, voxelSamp, uvw)` with `textureSampleLevel(voxelTex, voxelSamp, uvw, 0.0)` in both `fragmentMain` (line 120) and `fragmentPickMain` (line 159) of [WebGPUVoxelRenderer.ts](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUVoxelRenderer.ts). `textureSampleLevel` with explicit LOD 0 doesn't compute derivatives, so it has no uniform-control-flow requirement and naga accepts it inside the data-dependent ray-march loop. Volumetric voxel textures are single-mip, so forcing LOD 0 matches existing intent. Verified by re-running `SANDCASTLE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8082 node Tools/visual-regression/sandcastle-batch-66-final-runner.mjs` — the `'textureSample' must only be called from uniform control flow` error is gone from the Voxel Pick demo's console. NEW-4-H (next predicted blocker) immediately surfaced as expected.
**Files touched:** [packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUVoxelRenderer.ts](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUVoxelRenderer.ts) (2 paired textureSample → textureSampleLevel edits + WGSL comments referencing NEW-4-G).
**Closing batch:** Batch 69.

### ~~NEW-4-H — Voxel `updateWebGPUVoxelPrimitive` calls `Matrix4.multiplyByPoint` with undefined cartesian~~ FIXED 2026-04-26 (Batch 70)

**Resolution:** Two coupled root causes, both fixed in one batch:

1. **`UniformState.cameraPosition` getter was missing.** The TS `.d.ts` companion declared `readonly cameraPosition: Cartesian3` and ~13 WebGPU renderer call sites consumed it (`WebGPUVoxelRenderer`, `WebGPUCloudRenderer`, `WebGPUEllipsoidPrimitiveRenderer`, `WebGPUGaussianSplatRenderer`, `WebGPUPointCloudRenderer`, `WebGPUBufferPrimitiveRenderer`, `WebGPUGlobeSurfaceRenderer`, `WebGPUUniformGroupManager`, `WebGPUModelRenderer`, etc.) — but the JS class only had the private `_cameraPosition` field. Reads always returned `undefined`. Production builds masked this because `Check.typeOf.object` debug pragmas are stripped; the unminified Sandcastle build surfaced the first crash on the Voxel Pick demo. **Fix:** added `get cameraPosition() { return this._cameraPosition; }` to [UniformState.js](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/UniformState.js) next to `previousCameraPosition`. One line, restores the contract the .d.ts has always promised, fixes all 13 call sites at once.

2. **`DerivedCommand.createDepthOnlyDerivedCommand` lacked the WebGPU shader-program guard** that its sibling `createLogDepthCommand` already had (NEW-5-A, Batch 66). Once Voxel Pick reached the per-frame derived-command sweep, `Scene.updateDerivedCommands → DerivedCommand.createDepthOnlyDerivedCommand` was called for every WebGPU command, and `getDepthOnlyShaderProgram → ShaderCache.getDerivedShaderProgram` dereferenced `shaderProgram._cachedShader` on a WebGPU command (which carries a `GPUShaderModule`-backed pipeline, not a WebGL `ShaderProgram` with `id` / `_cachedShader` fields). Crashed both Voxel Pick AND Translucent Classification with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_cachedShader')`. **Fix:** added the symmetric `if (!defined(cmdShader?.id))` guard at the top of [DerivedCommand.createDepthOnlyDerivedCommand](../packages/engine/Source/Scene/DerivedCommand.js) — copies the WebGPU shader/renderState through unchanged, leaving the WebGPU dispatcher (`selectCommandVariant`) to route depth-only via its own `derivedCommands.depth.command` slot with a pre-built WGSL pipeline.

**Files touched:** [packages/engine/Source/Renderer/UniformState.js](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/UniformState.js) (added `cameraPosition` getter), [packages/engine/Source/Scene/DerivedCommand.js](../packages/engine/Source/Scene/DerivedCommand.js) (added NEW-4-H WebGPU guard mirroring NEW-5-A).

**Sandcastle verification:** `WebGPU Voxel Pick.html` PASS (was FAIL since Batch 66). Sandcastle baseline jumped from 5/7 to 6/7 PASS in this batch alone; Translucent Classification's `_cachedShader` co-failure is also resolved by the same DerivedCommand.js fix, leaving only its separate depth-format-copy-compat issue (tracked as NEW-4-I).

**Closing batch:** Batch 70.

### ~~NEW-4-I — Translucent Classification copies Depth24PlusStencil8 → Depth24Plus (incompatible formats)~~ FIXED 2026-04-27 (Batch 71)

**Resolution:** Took candidate (a) — flipped the `_translucentDepthTexture` allocation in [WebGPUTranslucentTileClassification.update](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUTranslucentTileClassification.ts) from `format: "depth24plus"` to `format: "depth24plus-stencil8"` so it matches the scene FB depth attachment (`SceneFramebuffer-Color_depth`). The `copyTextureToTexture` call in `executeTranslucentDepthPass` now passes WebGPU spec validation. The sampleable view at `_translucentDepthSampleableView` already pinned `aspect: "depth-only"` so the pack pipeline still reads only the depth channel — the stencil aspect is allocated but never sampled. Cost: one stencil byte per pixel (~negligible at any practical viewport size). The unused `_translucentDepthView` (default-aspect, dead code from a prior refactor) was left in place since it's never consumed and removing it is out of scope. Verified by re-running `SANDCASTLE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8082 node Tools/visual-regression/sandcastle-batch-66-final-runner.mjs` after `npx gulp build` — Translucent Classification went from FAIL to PASS, taking the Sandcastle baseline from 6/7 to **7/7 PASS** (first time all WebGPU demos green on real WebGPU since the Batch 66 baseline framework was introduced).
**Files touched:** [packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUTranslucentTileClassification.ts](../packages/engine/Source/Renderer/WebGPU/WebGPUTranslucentTileClassification.ts) (1-line format change + NEW-4-I rationale comment).
**Closing batch:** Batch 71.

## ~~BUG-F2 — ShaderBuilder crash on BENTLEY edge asset~~ FIXED (Batch 66)

### ~~F2-SHADERBUILDER-EMPTY-FUNCTION~~ FIXED 2026-04-25 (Batch 66)
**Resolution:** Root cause was NOT property-table mismatch as initially diagnosed. The March 2026 ES6 modernization commit (`febe065f36`) added a debug-only `throw new DeveloperError("The shader function must have at least one line.")` to `ShaderFunction.generateGlslLines()`. `MetadataPipelineStage.declareStructsAndFunctions` legitimately registers `initializeMetadata` / `setMetadataVaryings` unconditionally (so `MetadataStageVS/FS` chunks can call them as no-ops when the model has no metadata), and most glTF assets — Milk Truck, EdgeVisibility test assets, BENTLEY — fall into the empty-body path. **Fix:** removed the empty-body throw in [ShaderFunction.js](packages/engine/Source/Renderer/ShaderFunction.js). GLSL allows empty function bodies (`void foo() {}` is valid); the pre-modernization behaviour silently emitted them. Diagnosis was complicated because the prior verification's "BENTLEY-specific" framing was wrong — the simpler `EdgeVisibilityMaterial.glb` (zero metadata) hit the same path on re-verification, which is what surfaced the actual root cause.
**Closing batch:** Batch 66 ShaderFunction.js empty-body fix.

## Cross-cutting priority guide

> **Update 2026-04-27 (Batch 71 reconciliation):** the prior version of this guide led with "C-R5-IMAGERY-16 is the single biggest visual-correctness gap remaining". That citation was lifted from `OVERSIGHT_AUDIT_2026_04_25.md` §2, which was written hours before Batch 58 closed C-R5-IMAGERY-16 (16-layer cap + 5 missing per-layer uniforms shipped — see [PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md § C-R5](PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEW_RENDERER_DEEP_2026_04_16.md)). The audit's recommendation #2 was acted on; the doc trail just never reconciled the closure into this priority guide. C-R5 is no longer the lead item — the highest-impact open correctness work is now C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-MULTI-FRUSTUM.

1. **Highest-impact correctness wins first.** **C-R8-TRANSLUCENT-MULTI-FRUSTUM** produces visible artifacting in nearly every multi-frustum scene (every camera height crossing a logarithmic frustum boundary). 2 sessions, bounded.
2. **Architectural enablers second.** C-R7-RENDERER-MIGRATION-REMAINING + C-R7-SHADER-MODULE-DEDUP together unlock perf wins across the renderer fleet — mechanical pass × 9 renderers.
3. **C-R4-GLTF-KHR is its own multi-week workstream.** Don't pair with anything; consume sessions one extension at a time. KHR_texture_transform is the highest-impact single extension.
4. **C-R9-\* pick follow-ups are nice-to-have.** Per-feature pick / per-cell pick / OIT pick all matter for specific app types; not on critical path for migration parity.
5. **C-R12-PER-OBJECT-CACHES** is a "leave it until something breaks" item.
